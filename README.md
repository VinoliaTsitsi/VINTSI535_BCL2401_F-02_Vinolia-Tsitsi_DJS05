# DJS05 Project Brief: Building a Redux-Inspired Store for a Tally App
Overview
This project demonstrates a simple state management system implemented in JavaScript. It allows you to create a state, dispatch actions to modify the state, and retrieve the current state. The system supports basic actions such as adding to, subtracting from, and resetting the count.

Prerequisites
To run the code in this project, you need a JavaScript runtime environment. You can use Node.js or a browser console.

Project Structure
The project consists of a single JavaScript file that contains the following components:

createState Function: Creates and manages the state.
getState Method: Retrieves the current state.
dispatch Method: Dispatches actions to update the state.
Usage Example: Demonstrates how to use the state management system.

1. Run the code in a JavaScript runtime environment such as Node.js or a browser console.
2. Observe the console output to see the results of each action dispatched to the state management system.


## Conclusion

This project provides a simple implementation of a state management system in JavaScript. It demonstrates how to create, update, and retrieve state using a functional approach. This example serves as a foundation for understanding more complex state management solutions in JavaScript applications.
